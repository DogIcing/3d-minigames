## Wordle POC

> !important
> This is a proof-of-concept & is incomplete

### Introduction

This is a proof of concept built in three.js

This project is structured in a way that there is a home scene, which you begin in, that contains buildings.
These buildings house "experiences" which are associated to specific coordinates and scenes they apply to.
When a user enters the radius of an experience entry point, a red button appears in the lower-right corner of the page.
Experiences can be fully interactive, like in this example with wordle, or disable movements and remain static.

### Controls

- Arrow keys to walk around
- Left click + move mouse to turn & look around

### Gameplay

In this example, the wordle building does not have a custom texture and instead is rendered with plain colors.
The entry point is in the center of the yellow face of the object (e.g. where a door would be in a custom texture).
So just walk into the building wall LOL.
Once you enter the experience / wordle building, use the button to guess words
Be sure to walk around and explore the 3D-ness of the wordle game :D
